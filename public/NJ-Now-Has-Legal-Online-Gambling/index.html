        <h1 id="NJ-Now-Has-Legal-Online-Gambling"><a href="#NJ-Now-Has-Legal-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="NJ Now Has Legal Online Gambling"></a>NJ Now Has Legal Online Gambling</h1><p>On June 7, 2018, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy signed a bill that legalized internet gambling in the state. The new law allows licensed casinos in Atlantic City and racetracks in Monmouth and Ocean counties to offer online casino games, including slots, blackjack, and roulette.</p>
<p>The goal of the law is to help revive the casino industry in Atlantic City, which has been struggling in recent years. It is also hoped that the new law will create jobs in the Garden State.</p>
<p>Online gambling will be taxed at 10 percent of gross gaming revenue. The revenues from online gambling are expected to be about $13 million in 2019 and grow to $25 million by 2021.</p>
<p>Atlantic City casinos have been offering online gambling since 2013, but this is the first time that it has been legal statewide. There are currently 11 casinos operating in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>NJ Online Gambling Sites</p>
<p>There are a number of websites that offer online gambling services to residents of New Jersey. These include:</p>
<p>• Borgata Casino • Golden Nugget • Harrah’s • Tropicana • Virgin Casino</p>
<h1 id="NJ-Approves-Online-Gambling"><a href="#NJ-Approves-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="NJ Approves Online Gambling"></a>NJ Approves Online Gambling</h1><p>The state of New Jersey recently approved online gambling, which will allow people within the state to gamble on the internet. The law was passed in February 2013 and went into effect in November 2013. The Department of Gaming Enforcement released regulations for online gambling in September 2013.</p>
<p>There are a few restrictions on who can gamble online in New Jersey. You must be physically located within New Jersey’s borders in order to gamble, and you must be at least 21 years old. You may only gamble on websites that have been approved by the state, and those websites will have a special NJ gambling logo.</p>
<p>There are a variety of games that you can play online in New Jersey, including blackjack, roulette, slots, and poker. The minimum bet is $0.10, and the maximum bet is $5,000 per hand or game round. There is also a limit of $50,000 per day on how much you can win or lose while gambling online.</p>
<p>Online gambling will be taxed at a rate of 14%. Casinos must pay an additional 7% tax on their gross revenue from online gambling. This money will go towards promoting tourism in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>So far, only three casinos have been approved to offer online gambling: the Borgata Casino Hotel &amp; Spa, the Golden Nugget Atlantic City, and the Tropicana Casino and Resort. More casinos may be approved in the future.</p>
<h1 id="NJ-Becomes-Third-State-to-Approve-Online-Gambling"><a href="#NJ-Becomes-Third-State-to-Approve-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="NJ Becomes Third State to Approve Online Gambling"></a>NJ Becomes Third State to Approve Online Gambling</h1><p>On Monday, June 11, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy officially signed a bill into law that allows for the operation of regulated online gambling in the state. This makes NJ the third US state to offer regulated iGaming, following Nevada and Delaware.</p>
<p>The new law will take effect on January 10, 2019 and will allow Atlantic City casinos and racetracks to offer both online poker and casino games to residents of the Garden State. Online gambling will be available to players aged 21 or older and will be subject to a tax rate of 13 percent on gross gaming revenue.</p>
<p> Murphy commented on the news, stating that it was “a great day for Atlantic City and the thousands of workers who depend on our casino industry.” He added that the new law would help to “protect consumers, promote responsible gaming and create thousands of good jobs across our state.”</p>
<p>The enactment of this bill has been a long time coming for New Jersey, which has been attempting to legalize online gambling since 2013. The prior attempt failed due to resistance from then-Governor Chris Christie, but Murphy made legalization a key campaign promise during his 2017 run for governor.</p>
<p>Now that the bill has been signed into law, regulators will need to finalize the rules and regulations for online gambling in NJ before casinos can start offering services. This is expected to take several months, so players won’t be able to start wagering online until some time in early 2019.</p>
<p>In anticipation of legalized online gambling, several Atlantic City casinos have already made plans to launch their own iGaming platforms. Borgata Hotel Casino &amp; Spa was the first local casino to announce its intentions, with CEO Tom Balance commenting that they are “excited to provide our guests with another leading edge experience that enhances their visit to Atlantic City.”</p>
<h1 id="NJ-Opens-Doors-to-Legalized-Web-Gambling"><a href="#NJ-Opens-Doors-to-Legalized-Web-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="NJ Opens Doors to Legalized Web Gambling"></a>NJ Opens Doors to Legalized Web Gambling</h1><p>The New Jersey state assembly has approved a bill that would legalize web gambling within the state. The vote was passed unanimously, with 78 votes in favor.</p>
<p>If the bill is signed into law by Governor Chris Christie, it will allow licensed casinos in Atlantic City to offer online gambling services to residents of New Jersey. These services will include online poker, blackjack, and slot machines.</p>
<p>The passage of this bill is seen as a major victory for the casino industry in Atlantic City, which has been struggling to compete with casinos in other states. The legalization of web gambling could provide a much-needed boost to the city’s economy.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill argue that it will help to create new jobs and bolster tourism in Atlantic City. They also claim that it will generate millions of dollars in tax revenue for the state government.</p>
<p>Critics of the bill argue that it could lead to increased addiction rates and social problems. They also say that it will give an unfair advantage to casinos in Atlantic City over casinos in other states.</p>
<h1 id="NJ-Finally-Signs-Into-Law-Bill-on-Web-Gambling"><a href="#NJ-Finally-Signs-Into-Law-Bill-on-Web-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="NJ Finally Signs Into Law Bill on Web Gambling"></a>NJ Finally Signs Into Law Bill on Web Gambling</h1><p>“It is finally done,” stated Governor Chris Christie, minutes after he had put his signature onto A2578 - the bill on web gambling that had been stuck in the legislature for years. This makes New Jersey the third state in the US to legalize some form of internet gambling, after Nevada and Delaware.</p>
<p>The new law allows Atlantic City’s casinos to offer internet poker, casino games and slots to people in the state. The casinos will partner with outside companies who will provide the software and handle the financial transactions; this process is already underway, with several large companies expressing interest.</p>
<p>Players must be physically located in New Jersey in order to gamble online; out-of-state players are not allowed. This restriction is likely a response to worries that web gambling would siphon business away from Atlantic City’s casinos. “We are not trying to create an off-shore gambling experience,” said Assemblyman John Burzichelli, one of the sponsors of the bill. “We are trying to create an on-shore experience.”</p>
<p>Critics of the bill say that it does not do enough to protect players from fraud and abuse. There are no regulations governing how long a person must wait between withdrawing money and cashing out winnings; there are also no limits on how much a player can bet or lose in a given day. “This legislation fails to adequately address critical consumer protection issues,” said State Senator Jim Whelan.</p>
<p>Governor Christie defended the lack of regulations, arguing that they could be put into place later if needed. “I’m not going to do something today that’s going to be regretted tomorrow,” he said.</p>
