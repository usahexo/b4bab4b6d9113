#  Who Will Benefit Most from Dolores Del Rio's Return to Hollywood Gambling Establishment?

The forthcoming return of Hollywood gambling establishment magnate Dolores Del Rio to the city's hallowed gaming floors has many industry pundits scratching their heads. Exactly who will likely benefit most from her return?

The answer is not so obvious. On the one hand, Del Rio's re-emergence could be bad news for the dozens of smaller operators struggling to make a go of it in LA's competitive casino market. Her well-funded and well-connected enterprise is likely to gobble up market share, pushing many smaller outfits out of business.

But on the other hand, Del Rio's return could be a boon for the city's economy as a whole. The infusion of new capital and business acumen could help revive Hollywood's flagging gambling sector and restore it to its former glory. This, in turn, would create jobs and generate tax revenue for the city government.

So who really stands to gain from Dolores Del Rio's return to Hollywood? In the end, it may be everyone â€“ except the smaller operators who get pushed out of business by her arrival.

#  What Changes has Dolores Del Rio Made to her Game Ahead of Reopening Hollywood Gambling Establishment?

Dolores Del Rio is set to reopen her Hollywood gambling establishment on the 15th of this month. The gambling establishment, which was closed down in 2009 for non-compliance with regulations, has undergone some major changes in order to ensure that it meets regulatory requirements this time around.

One of the most notable changes is the installation of a new camera surveillance system. This system is designed to keep track of all activity inside and outside the casino, as well as monitor any suspicious behavior. In addition, the gambling establishment will now be staffed by security guards at all times.

Another change that has been made is the introduction of a new age restriction policy. Individuals who are under the age of 21 will not be allowed into the casino, regardless of whether they are accompanied by an adult or not.

These changes come after Del Rio was fined $100,000 by the California Gambling Control Commission for violations that occurred in 2009.
