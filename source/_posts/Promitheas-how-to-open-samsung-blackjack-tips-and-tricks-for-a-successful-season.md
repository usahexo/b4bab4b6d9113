#  Promitheas how to open samsung blackjack tips and tricks for a successful season

The Promitheas basketball club enters the 2017-2018 season with high hopes, as it tries to reclaim its place among the top teams in Europe.

To achieve this goal, the team will have to rely on strong play from veteran stars such as Ioannis Bourousis and Keith Langford, as well as on up-and-coming youngsters like Kostas Sloukas and Georgios Bogris.

In order for Promitheas to succeed this season, here are some tips and tricks that the team can use:

1. Play as a cohesive unit

One of the biggest problems that plagued Promitheas last season was their inability to play as a cohesive unit. This resulted in a number of players trying to do too much on offense, which ultimately led to disaster.

This season, head coach Giannis Sfairopoulos needs to get his players to buy into his system and play together as one unit. If they can do that, then they will be tough to beat.

2. Get good production from their veterans

Last season, Promitheas’s veterans didn’t live up to expectations. Bourousis was injured for most of the year and Langford was inconsistent throughout the season. If Promitheas wants to win this season, they need Bourousis and Langford to be productive on both ends of the floor.

3. Develop their young players

Promitheas has a few talented young players on their roster, including Sloukas and Bogris. These players need to be given an opportunity to shine this season, as they will be vital in the team’s success going forward.
