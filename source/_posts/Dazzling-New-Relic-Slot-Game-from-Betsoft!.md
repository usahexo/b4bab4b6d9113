An archaeologist is someone who studies the artifacts and relics of ancient civilizations. If you are interested in becoming an archaeologist, there are some basic requirements that you must meet.

If you meet these requirements and are interested in pursuing a career in archaeology, there are a few steps that you can take to get started. First, find out if there are any archaeology programs at your local college or university. There are also many field schools that offer introductory courses in archaeology. These courses will give you a basic understanding of the field and help you decide if archaeology is the right career for you.

Once you have some experience under your belt, it is important to build your resume by undertaking volunteer work or internships with archaeological institutions. This will give you valuable hands-on experience and networking opportunities. And finally, make sure to keep up with current archaeological research so that you can stay informed about new discoveries and methods in the field.
