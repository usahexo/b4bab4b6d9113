#  Argentina to default after missing debt payment

Argentina defaulted on its debt for the second time in 13 years after failing to make a payment to bondholders, deepening the economic crisis in the country.

President Mauricio Macri said that he would seek to negotiate with the holdout creditors who are demanding full payment of the $1.5 billion they are owed.

However, Economy Minister Nicolas Dujovne said that there was "zero chance" of reaching a negotiated settlement with the holdouts and that Argentina would instead pursue a legal strategy.

The default could see Argentina banned from international capital markets for years and deepen an economic crisis which has seen inflation spiral out of control and unemployment reach record levels.

It is also likely to heighten political tensions in Argentina, where Macri's approval ratings have fallen sharply since he took office in 2015.

In 2001, Argentina became the first country to ever default on its debt in Latin America when it failed to meet payments totaling around $100 billion.

#  IMF loan to Argentina falls through

After months of negotiations, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has decided not to give Argentina a loan. The Argentine government had been hoping to receive $30 billion from the IMF in order to help stabilise the country’s economy.

The move comes as a surprise, as the IMF has previously said that it was willing to provide assistance to Argentina. However, the organisation has now said that it is not comfortable with Argentina’s plans to reduce its budget deficit.

The decision is likely to be a blow to Argentine president Mauricio Macri, who came to power in 2015 promising to revive the country’s economy. The Argentine economy has struggled in recent years, with high inflation and unemployment rates.

In a statement, the IMF said that it would continue to support Argentina and was working with the government on a program that could be presented in the future.

#  Argentines rush to supermarkets amid fears of economic crisis

In the past few weeks, Argentines have been rushing to supermarkets to stock up on food and other basic items amid fears of an impending economic crisis. This comes as the country's currency, the peso, has lost more than 50% of its value against the US dollar in the past year.

Many Argentines are concerned that they may not be able to afford basic goods and services if the economic situation continues to deteriorate. In response, many people are buying large quantities of food and other essentials, in an effort to prepare for the worst.

Some supermarkets have even started rationing certain items, such as bread and milk, due to high demand. Others have raised their prices dramatically in order to cope with increased costs.

The Argentinian government has denied that there is a crisis brewing, but many people are not convinced. Some economists have warned that the country is on the brink of a full-blown financial meltdown.

The situation in Argentina is a reminder of how rapidly things can change in a volatile economy. It is important for people to be prepared for all eventualities, including an economic crisis.

#  Argentine peso hits all-time low against US dollar

The Argentine peso hit an all-time low against the US dollar on Thursday, prompting the government to impose a series of restrictions on foreign exchange purchases in an effort to halt the slide.

The peso lost more than 17% of its value against the greenback in just one day, hitting 23.7 per dollar. The currency has now lost more than half its value since January.

The government announced a series of measures to try to stop the hemorrhaging, including a temporary ban on buying dollars for savings and limits on purchases of dollars for commercial purposes. President Mauricio Macri also announced that he was sending his economy minister to Washington to meet with the IMF in order to seek financial assistance.

The economic crisis in Argentina has been years in the making, as the country has struggled with high inflation and massive budget deficits. The government has been desperately trying to get its finances under control, but the measures it has taken so far have failed to calm investors’ fears.

The plunge in the peso is particularly bad news for Argentines, who have seen their purchasing power erode rapidly as prices for goods and services soar. Inflation was running at more than 30% last year, and is expected to be even higher this year.

Many Argentines have been scrambling to buy dollars in an effort to protect their savings, but with the government now placing restrictions on those purchases, that may become increasingly difficult.
