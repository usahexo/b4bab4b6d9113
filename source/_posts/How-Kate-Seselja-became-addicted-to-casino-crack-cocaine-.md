#  How Kate Seselja became addicted to casino crack cocaine 

Kate Seselja was born on October 14, 1965 in Spokane, Washington to parents of Croatian descent. Her father was a miner and her mother stayed at home to take care of the children. Kate was their third child and had two older sisters. As a youngster, she loved to ride horses, chase frogs, and play in the creek behind her house.

In junior high school, Kate began drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes with her friends. When she was 15 years old, she smoked her first marijuana joint and became instantly hooked. In high school, she started using cocaine and quickly became addicted. She also began stealing money from her parents to buy drugs.

At 18 years old, Kate dropped out of school and moved to Reno, Nevada to live with her sister. She soon began working as a cocktail waitress in a casino and started using crack cocaine. Within a few months, she was addicted to the drug and spent most of her time gambling in the casino.

She lost all of her money gambling and started stealing from the casino employees to support her drug habit. She also began prostituting herself for money to buy drugs. On several occasions, she was arrested for prostitution and drug possession, but she always managed to get out of jail and return to the casino.

In 1994, Kate met John Seselja at a casino in Reno. They married later that year and relocated to San Diego, California. John got a job as a shipyard welder and Kate continued working as a cocktail waitress in a casino. Within a few months of moving to San Diego, Kate became pregnant with their first child.

John was an alcoholic and frequently beat Kate up when he was drunk. In 1998, John was arrested for domestic violence and sentenced to six months in jail. While he was incarcerated, Kate gave birth to their son and moved back in with her parents in Spokane, Washington.

After John's release from jail, they divorced and he moved back to Reno, Nevada while Kate remained in Spokane with their son. In 2000, Kate met Charles Elliott at a casino in Spokane and they soon married. Charles was also an alcoholic and frequently abused Kate both physically and emotionally.

#  Casino playing led to crack cocaine addiction for Kate Seselja 

In October of 2009, Kate Seselja’s life changed forever when she became addicted to crack cocaine as a result of casino gambling. At the time, Seselja was in her early twenties and had been married for just over a year. She and her husband frequented casinos in an effort to make money they could use to support their lifestyle. However, things soon spiraled out of control and they began to lose money instead of making it. In order to try and win it back, they started gambling with ever-increasing amounts of money. Eventually, they ran out of funds and started borrowing money from friends and family members. 

Seselja’s addiction got so bad that she was doing nothing else but gambling and using drugs. She lost her job, her home, and most importantly, her marriage. Her husband filed for divorce and took custody of their young son. Seselja was left with nothing but the clothes on her back. 

She spent the next few years bouncing around between different states, living in shelters or on the streets. Occasionally she would find temporary work, but it was never enough to get her back on her feet. Her addiction only continued to worsen and she was regularly using not just crack cocaine but also methamphetamines, heroin, and benzodiazepines. 

In 2013, Seselja finally bottomed out and realized that she needed help. She checked herself into a rehabilitation center and began the long road to recovery. It was a difficult process, but with the support of her family and friends, she eventually managed to get clean. 

Today, Seselja is a different person than she was before her addiction began. She is now a mother of two young children and is married to the man who helped her through rehabilitation. She is also a mental health counselor who specializes in helping people with addictions recover from their pasts

#  How casino gambling turned Kate Seselja into a crack cocaine addict 

Kate Seselja’s descent into addiction began with casino gambling. A stay-at-home mom of two in her early 30s, she had always been a cautious person. But the allure of the slot machines was too much to resist.

“The first time I went to a casino, I drank too much and lost all my money,” Seselja said. “But I was hooked. The excitement of potentially winning big was just too strong.”

She started gambling more frequently, eventually spending hours at a time playing the slots. To fuel her addiction, she started using cocaine — which she could afford because of the money she was losing at the casino.

“The combination of cocaine and gambling was lethal,” Seselja said. “I became completely addicted to both drugs. I would do anything to get my hands on money so that I could gamble it away at the casino.”

Her addiction soon took over her life. She stopped caring about her children or anything else that used to matter to her. All she cared about was getting more cocaine and more cash to gamble with.

Seselja hit rock bottom when she pawned her engagement ring and wedding band for drug money. Shortly after, she decided to seek help and entered rehab. It has been several years since she has gambled or used drugs, and she is now a recovery advocate working to help others struggling with addiction.

Gambling can be an extremely addictive behavior, as Kate Seselja's story shows. If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, please seek professional help as soon as possible.

#  How Kate Seselja's casino addiction led to crack cocaine abuse 

Kate Seselja's casino addiction led to crack cocaine abuse. She estimated that she lost $1 million gambling in the three years before she sought help. "I was so ashamed of myself," Seselja said. "I knew I had a problem, but I couldn't stop." 

Seselja's story is all too common. According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, about two percent of the American population has a gambling addiction. That amounts to about 4 million people. 

And while there are plenty of resources for people with alcohol and drug addictions, there are far fewer for those with gambling problems. Part of the reason may be that gambling addiction is seen as a moral failing, rather than a disease. 

"Gambling addiction is viewed as a character flaw, as opposed to a true medical condition," said Keith Whyte, executive director of the National Council on Problem Gambling. "As a result, many people with gambling problems don't seek help because they're ashamed or embarrassed." 

That's changing, however, as more and more people come forward to share their stories. And with help available, there's no reason for those with gambling problems to suffer in silence.

#  Kate Seselja: how casino gambling led to my addiction to crack cocaine

People often ask me how I got into drugs. The answer is both simple and complicated. It started with casino gambling.

I grew up in a small town in rural Australia. When I was 18, I moved to the city to go to university. I quickly made friends with a group of people who were into casino gambling. We would go to the casino every weekend and spend hours playing the slots.

At first, I thought it was just a bit of fun. But soon, I became hooked on the thrill of gambling. The high I got from winning was unlike anything I had ever experienced before.

As my addiction grew, so did my need for money to gamble with. I started working at a casino as a croupier to make more money. And then I started stealing from work to fund my gambling habit.

My life spiralled out of control and I soon found myself using crack cocaine to get high. The addiction took over my life and I lost everything – my job, my friends, my family.

I was finally arrested and sent to prison for drug trafficking. It was there that I realised how bad my addiction had become and decided to get help.

Now, several years later, I am clean and sober. Gambling no longer has any appeal for me. It's safe to say that casino gambling led me down a path that ultimately led to my addiction to crack cocaine.
