#  How to block Wagering Sites on Android BK8 

There are many online casino and sports betting sites that are not legal in certain parts of the world. If you want to block these sites on your Android device, there are a few methods you can use.

The first way is to use a VPN service. A VPN will hide your IP address and make it seem like you are located in a different part of the world. This will allow you to bypass any restrictions that your country or region has in place.

The second way is to use a website blocker app. These apps will allow you to blacklist specific websites or entire categories of websites. This is a great option if you only want to block gambling sites, or if you want to block all adult content on your device.

The third way is to use parental controls. Most Android devices have parental control options built-in. These options will allow you to restrict access to certain websites or apps on your device. This is a great option for parents who want to keep their children away from harmful content.

There are a variety of ways to block betting websites on Android devices, but we’ll cover two of the most common methods.

The first way is to use an app like Betfilter Pro, which is specifically designed to block online gambling sites. The app is available for purchase on the Google Play Store.

Once installed, the app will automatically scan your device for any gambling websites and will then block them. You can also add specific websites to the app’s blacklist if you want to block them manually.

The second way to block betting sites on Android is to use a built-in feature called Parental Controls. This feature is available on most Android devices and can be used to restrict access to certain websites.

To enable Parental Controls, go to Settings > Security > Parental Controls and toggle the switch on. Once enabled, you can specify which websites you want to restrict access to.

There are a number of ways to block gambling sites on Android, but we’ll show you the easiest way.

Method 1: Use a Third-Party App

There are a number of third-party apps that can help you block gambling sites on Android. One popular app is called “Blockit – Anti Gambling”. This app is available for free on the Google Play Store.

Once you have installed the app, open it and tap on the “Gambling Sites” tab. Then, simply tap on the “Add Site” button and add the gambling site that you want to block.

You can also use the app to block other types of websites, such as pornographic websites. To do this, open the app and tap on the “Other Websites” tab. Then, tap on the “Add Site” button and add the website that you want to block.

Method 2: Use Your Browser’s Built-In Blocking Feature

If you don’t want to use a third-party app, you can use your browser’s built-in blocking feature to block gambling sites on Android. This method is just as easy as using a third-party app.

To block gambling sites using your browser’s built-in blocking feature, open your browser and tap on the three dots in the top right corner of the screen. Then, tap on “Settings” and select “Site Settings”. Next, scroll down until you see the section labelled “Gambling Sites”. Then, toggle the switch next to “Block Sites” to On/Green.

Now, when you try to visit a gambling site, you will see a message stating that this website has been blocked by your browser.

There are many reasons why you might want to block casino sites on your Android device. Maybe you’re trying to save money, or you don’t want to be tempted by the allure of gambling. Whatever your reason, it’s surprisingly easy to do.

The first thing you need to do is install a content blocker. We recommend using [1]Adblock Browser for Android, as it’s one of the most effective blockers available and it’s free to download.

Once you have the Adblock Browser installed, open it up and click on the three lines in the top left corner. Select “Settings” from the menu that appears.

In the Settings menu, scroll down until you see the option for “Proxy Filter list”. Click on this, then select “Add a New Proxy Filter List”.

In the new window that opens, enter the following URL: 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nepalsites/bk8-android/master/casinosites.txt

Now click on the “Add hostname(s)” button and type in any casino site URLs that you want to block. When you’re done, click on “OK” and then close out of all of the other windows.

The next time you open up Adblock Browser, the casinossites.txt file will be loaded and any casino sites that you entered will be blocked.
